# mysterious-night
Ever wonder what it would be like to think that you are about to embark on a quest to solve some sort of mystery only to find out that it's not real? In fact, nothing was real. Your kind of moving around in a never-ending loop of confusion, and just when you think things start to make sense, they don't. That's how dreaming feels like, but sometimes that's how reality feels like too. So take this journey with your friend, The Raven, and you shall see exactly what's going on, or you won't. Either way, have fun. You can at least do that, can't you?
